To learn the CQRS and ES, I took a look at the CQRS Journey from Microsoft (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/msp-n-p/jj554200(v=pandp.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN)

For learning purpose:
1. I eliminate functionalities just retain simple functions such as create conference, publish and unpusblish conference
2. I convert to use ASP.NET Core 3.1.1, Web API, Entity Framework Core, Blazor Server, MassTransit and RabbitMQ
